# How to run the application

1. Open the terminal in the folder where you downloaded the application to.


2. If on Mac or linux then we need to make the script executable. Run 'chmod +x run.sh'. This will make sure you can run the script.

```
chmod +x run.sh
```

3. Run the actual run.sh script on Mac or Linux, run.ps1 on Windows.
```
./run.sh
```
```
./run.ps1
```
